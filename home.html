      <p class="overview">For this group project, we created a high fidelity prototype for 
        the startup, Nototo, based off of a description of their interface. Throughout 
        the process, we created sketches, lo-fi, and hi-fi prototypes, received Feedback
        from an industry professional, and uploaded our prototype to usertesting.com to 
        get real user input.

      <h2>Startup Info</h2>
      <p>Nototo is a note-taking software that allows users to take advantage of their 
        visual-spatial memory. The intention behind the workspace is to store any 
        volume of information in however layout a user decides. The result is an 
        infinite “map”  that the user(s) continuously builds upon. A key feature is 
        the zooming aspect of the workspace, whereby all the notes are visible when 
        a user zooms out and as the user zooms in, more specific categories, media 
        and notes become visible. </p>

      <h2>Sketches</h2>
      <p>We began by sketching our ideas for the interface to brainstom potential
        layouts and functionalities.</p>
      <img class="compiledSketches" alt="Compiled Sketches" src="compiledsketchcolor.svg">
      <p>After combining all our ideas from our sketches, we created a lo-fi 
        prototype for our interface.

      <h2>Mockup and Critique Feedback</h2></h3>
      <p>After creating a lo-fi prototype for Nototo, we made our hi-fi prototype
        in Figma to implement our ideas.

      <h3>Critique Feedback</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Upper left corner is the most important call to action
          <ul><li>Maybe move “back to home” and “create element” buttons to top of screen (core navigation) </li></ul>
        </li>
        <li>+/- zoom in and zoom out button is good for ppl who use screen reader (affordances)</li>
        <li>breadcrumb system so you don’t get lost (maybe a path)</li>
        <li>Mini-Map in corner to show where you are in screen</li>
        <li>Click outside of bubble or sheet to zoom out </li>
        <li>Create a visual hierarchy </li>
        <li>Reduce number of type faces on home screen to 1-2</li>
        <li>back to home button on the biology screen is not linked</li>
        <li>Clicking “sign up” also takes me to the login screen, consider adjusting 
          the hot spot</li>

      <h2>User Testing</h2>
      <h3>Testing Instructions</h3>
      <p>Sign into Nototo, add an image to the blank document in the biology lab bubble, then, log out.</p>
      <h3>Post Test Questions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Did you feel that the website gave you enough information and cues to feel comfortable using the interface and navigating to the correct topic? Explain your answer.</li>
        <li>What, if anything, is missing on this page?</li>
        <li>What 3 words would you use to describe this interface? Would you feel comfortable using Nototo for your note-taking? Explain your answer.</li>

      <h3>Summary of User Testing Results</h3>
        <div class="users">
          <div class="item">
            <h4>User 1:</h4>
            <p class="userPara">The user had a hard time navigating through the button options. 
              The user expressed confusion when attempting to add the image to the 
              document as they weren’t sure if the “add element” button would allow 
              them to add an image. Other than that, the user expressed that the layout 
              was intuitive but would have liked the title of the image to appear within 
              the document somewhere (maybe outside the document at the bottom). 
              Additionally, they wanted greater freedom in being able to customize and 
              edit their layout than what was modeled in the prototype. They enjoyed how 
              quickly it was to add an image and wanted that to be the case for other elements. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="item">
            <h4>User 2:</h4>
            <p class="userPara">Although the user expressed the interface seemed intuitive, 
              they had trouble adding an image to the lab document. They initially thought 
              that the image should have been added as its own bubble within the biology 
              bubble. This user expressed that the interface and layout was visually 
              appealing and that the user flow was engaging. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="item">
            <h4>User 3:</h4>
            <p class="userPara">This user had difficulty adding the image due to 
              the different way they thought of adding the image (with the toolbar 
              on top of the document as opposed to the “add element” button at the bottom). </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="summaryResults">
          <h3>Summary of Results</h3>
          <p>Explanation of results: Overall, though the interface seemed intuitive to most of the users, 
            there was confusion across the board for how to properly insert an image to a document or element 
            in one of the bubbles. The users had to experiment clicking on various other elements first 
            before realizing what they had to do. As a result, they would kind of backtrack to 
            where their initial startpoint was and after exploring the other elements, 
            move from that initial startpoint.  </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="subtasks">
        <h3>Summary of Subtasks</h3>
        <p>To add the image, the user had to navigate to the biology topic bubble. 
          There, they had to click on the lab bubble and further click on the blank 
          document within that lab section. From there, they had to press the “add 
          element” button which directs them to import an image or import video. The 
          user then had to click on import image, select the image from their computer, 
          and then click “select image.” One that was done, the user had to click on my 
          account and navigate to the “sign out” bubble. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="errors">
        <h3>Errors Users Made</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Did not realize that they have to click on add element in order to 
            insert the document to the lab - thought that they should click on the 
            toolbar of the blank document instead 
            <ul>
              <li>Therefore they weren't able to complete the task</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Multiple users were confused by the task directions; they thought 
              that the image should be added to the biology bubble as a separate 
              bubble rather than within a document inside the lab bubble. </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="userPerformance">
        <h3>General User Performance</h3>
        <p>Most of the users were able to complete the task but it was evident that  
          they tried other methods first to do so. However, those that weren’t able 
          to complete the task couldn’t complete it because of confusion pertaining 
          to which method of adding the image was intuitive for them. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="potentialChanges">
        <h3>Potential Changes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Clarify in the user testing instructions that the user should be adding 
            a document to the lab section as they go through the test; have the testng 
            instructions guide the user rather than just give them a task and a question 
            at the beginning. </li>
            <li>In terms of layout, perhaps making the add element button more of a 
              fan with multiple functionalities (add image, text, etc.) that pops up 
              when the user hovers over the button</li>
            <li>Simplify the navigation bar at the top of the document to make it clear 
              to the user that to insert elements they should use the add element button</li>
        </ul>
